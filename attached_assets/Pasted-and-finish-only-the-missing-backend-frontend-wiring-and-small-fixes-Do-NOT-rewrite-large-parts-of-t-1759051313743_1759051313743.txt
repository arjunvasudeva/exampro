and finish only the missing backend/frontend wiring and small fixes. Do NOT rewrite large parts of the app.

1) Fix exam-questions load reliability:
- Investigate POST /api/exam-sessions and GET /api/exam-sessions/:id/questions.
- Fix cause of intermittent "Loading exam questions…" (either session created without questionIds or frontend parsing error).
- Ensure storage.getRandomQuestions() returns correct questions when admin has created questions (match examName).
- Add clear error handling: if NO_QUESTIONS, show admin-friendly message on admin panel and student-friendly message on student page.

2) Admin endpoints needed:
- Add PATCH /api/hall-tickets/:id/move-to-draft to mark a ticket as draft (do not delete).
- Add GET /api/hall-tickets?bin=draft (or /api/hall-tickets/draft) to list draft tickets.

3) Admin results page & routes:
- Ensure frontend route /admin/results exists and links in admin UI.
- Create a minimal /admin/results page that calls GET /api/exam-sessions/:id (admin auth) and displays results (student name, hallTicketId, answers, score, status).

4) Fix admin button errors:
- Fix frontend calls for Delete Hall Ticket, Flag Student, Resolve — ensure they use the correct API endpoints and include auth token.
- Make server responses consistent (400/500 payloads) for the UI to show friendly messages.

5) Live monitoring & camera:
- Debug why student camera shows black on admin monitor: ensure student client sends video or snapshots via WebSocket or REST; ensure admin subscribes to those events.
- If needed, implement a simple fallback where students send periodic snapshots to `POST /api/monitoring-logs` and admin UI polls/receives those.

Important: after making code changes, run the app locally in Replit preview and verify the following in this order (commit after each success):
1) Admin creates questions for exam X via /admin/questions.
2) Admin creates hall ticket for exam X and student uses it.
3) Start exam — questions load without “Loading…”.
4) Submit exam — results viewable in /admin/results and hall ticket moves to Draft Bin.

Do only the above items. Do not change anything else.
